- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas on all user inputs
- **Output Encoding**: Svelte's automatic HTML encoding

### 🍪 Cookie Security
- **HttpOnly**: Auth cookies protected from XSS
- **Secure**: HTTPS-only in production
- **SameSite**: Lax policy for proper functionality
- **Path**: Properly scoped cookie paths

### 📸 Visual Regression
- **Screenshot Testing**: Baseline images for critical pages
- **Cross-Device**: Desktop (1280x720) and mobile (375x667) viewports
- **Dynamic Content**: Proper masking of user-specific elements
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading state captures

### ♿ Accessibility Testing
- **Axe Integration**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance testing
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab order and Enter/Space activation
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper role and label validation
- **Screen Reader**: Navigation and button accessibility

### 📈 Coverage Configuration
```typescript
thresholds: {
  global: { statements: 80, branches: 75, functions: 80, lines: 80 },
  'src/lib/utils/': { statements: 90, branches: 85, functions: 90, lines: 90 },
  'src/lib/server/api-utils.ts': { statements: 95, branches: 90, functions: 95, lines: 95 }
}
```
