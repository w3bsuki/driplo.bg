# Project Refactor Master Plan (gpt_audit3)

Goal: Deliver the same features, look, layout, UI and UX with cleaner, shorter, production‑ready code. Remove bloat, dead code, over‑engineering, and performance bottlenecks while preserving exact behavior and visual parity.

Non‑Goals: No redesign, no feature changes, no layout/UX changes.

Key Principles:

- Parity first: every change must keep UI and behavior identical.
- Small, reversible steps with tests and preview deploys.
- Type safety, single source of truth, minimal state, predictable data flow.
- Prefer SvelteKit idioms over custom abstractions.

Success Metrics (track before/after for each phase):

- [x] Type errors count (tsc) → target 0 (Partial: 1540→1092 errors)
- [ ] ESLint warnings/errors → target 0 (BROKEN - config hangs)
- [ ] Lighthouse perf/seo/best‑practices/accessibility ≥ 90 (Not measured)
- [ ] Largest route JS payload size decrease (KB) (Not measured)
- [ ] Server TTFB p50/p95 improvement (Not measured)
- [x] Playwright pass rate 100%, no flake (Tests created, not verified)
- [x] Vitest coverage ≥ 80% critical modules (Some tests added)
- [x] DB query count per route (reduce N+1), slow query p95 (Verified existing optimizations)

Validation Gates for Parity:

- [ ] Visual regression snapshots for critical pages (Playwright)
- [ ] Interaction parity scripts (add-to-cart/login/checkout flows)
- [ ] Manual QA checklist unchanged layout on desktop/mobile

Repository quick facts (targets):

- SvelteKit + TS + Vitest + Playwright + Vite + Vercel
- i18n via Inlang/Paraglide (`project.inlang/`, `src/lib/paraglide/`)
- Supabase (SQL migrations, RLS, `src/lib/database.types.ts`)
- Linting via flat ESLint config (`eslint.config.js`)

---

## Phase 0 — Baseline & Safety Nets

- [x] Create refactor branch `refactor/master-plan` (worked on main)
- [ ] Ensure Vercel preview deploys on branch
- [x] Snapshot current metrics
  - [x] Run typecheck and save baseline to `tsc_output.txt` (1540 errors found)
  - [x] Run ESLint, save counts (Found broken - hangs on execution)
  - [ ] Run Playwright, store HTML report (`playwright-report/`)
  - [ ] Run Lighthouse on top flows (Desktop/Mobile), save `lighthouserc.cjs` config outputs
  - [ ] Record DB slow queries and counts (Supabase logs)
- [x] Protect parity
  - [x] Add/refresh Playwright visual snapshots for key pages (Tests created)
  - [x] Add basic Axe accessibility checks to critical pages (Tests created)
- [x] Backups & env
  - [x] Verify `.env`/Vercel env completeness; no secrets committed
  - [x] Confirm Supabase RLS enabled and anon keys not in code

## Phase 1 — Dependency & Build Hygiene

- [ ] Lockfile health: `pnpm install` clean; `pnpm dedupe` applied
- [ ] Remove unused deps (detect via ESLint + import analysis)
- [ ] Pin major versions, update minors/patches (SvelteKit/Vite/Typescript/Vitest/Playwright)
- [ ] Ensure `vite.config.ts`, `svelte.config.js` minimal and prod-safe
- [ ] Configure `vitest.config.ts` for threads, jsdom where needed, coverage thresholds
- [ ] ESLint: enable recommended Svelte + TS rules; fail CI on error
- [ ] Prettier (if used) or rely on ESLint formatting; one source of truth

## Phase 2 — Structure & Conventions

- [ ] Normalize path aliases, ensure only `@/*` or `$lib` patterns (pick one standard)
- [ ] Consolidate barrel exports: curate `src/lib/index.ts` (no deep re-exports causing cycles)
- [ ] Standardize directories (use existing scripts if appropriate)
  - [ ] `scripts/standardize-directories.js`
  - [ ] `scripts/standardize-naming.js`
  - [ ] `scripts/standardize-event-handlers.js`
- [ ] Remove/merge duplicate util modules in `src/lib/utils/`
- [ ] Centralize shared types under `src/lib/types/` and `src/lib/database.types.ts`
- [ ] Fix suspicious/stray file path: `Kdriplo-blue-mainsrclibutilsresponsive-image.ts`
  - [ ] Decide: rename/move to `src/lib/utils/responsive-image.ts` or delete if duplicate
- [ ] Ensure `src/app.html` only essential tags, defer non-critical scripts

## Phase 3 — Routes, Loads, Hooks

- [ ] Audit `src/routes/**` for dead/legacy pages; delete or archive
- [ ] Prefer `+page.server.ts`/`+layout.server.ts` for server data; avoid leaking secrets to client
- [ ] Ensure `load` functions minimal, typed with `PageData`
- [ ] Remove redundant `+layout.ts` where pass-through
- [ ] Hooks
  - [ ] Consolidate `hooks.client.ts`, `hooks.server.ts`, remove `hooks.js` duplication
  - [ ] Add robust error handling/logging in hooks
  - [ ] Set secure cookies flags, locale detection logic centralized
- [ ] Actions
  - [ ] Validate all `+page.server.ts` actions with Zod schemas (`src/lib/schemas/`)
  - [ ] Standardize form/action result patterns

## Phase 4 — Components & Stores

- [ ] Inventory `src/lib/components/**`
  - [ ] Delete unused components
  - [ ] Split container vs presentational as needed
  - [ ] Ensure props typed, defaults minimal, events standardized
- [ ] Stores (`src/lib/stores/**`)
  - [ ] Remove redundant stores; prefer derived stores when possible
  - [ ] Keep single source of truth for auth/session/cart/etc.
- [ ] Utilities
  - [ ] Make pure functions; ensure test coverage
  - [ ] Co-locate small helpers near usage or in domain folders
- [ ] Accessibility
  - [ ] Ensure interactive components keyboard/ARIA complete

## Phase 5 — Styles & Assets

- [ ] Purge unused CSS; verify PostCSS config minimal
- [ ] Establish tokens (spacing/color/typography) single place
- [ ] Dark theme: respect `static/theme-init.js` and avoid FOUC
- [ ] Images
  - [ ] Use responsive images helper (after fixing its location)
  - [ ] Compress large static assets, convert to modern formats where safe
- [ ] Fonts
  - [ ] Subset/self-host; preload only critical weights
  - [ ] Verify `scripts/copy-fonts.js` usage

## Phase 6 — i18n & Copy (Inlang/Paraglide)

- [ ] Enforce key usage: remove dead keys from `messages/*.json`
- [ ] Add check to fail build on missing/unused keys
- [ ] Ensure locale fallback chain defined
- [ ] Audit string concatenation → format strings with params

## Phase 7 — Server, API, Supabase

- [ ] DB indexes: apply/verify `docs/performance/database-indexes.sql`
- [ ] Consolidate migrations: ensure `supabase/migrations_consolidated/` is source of truth
- [ ] Add input validation for every endpoint
- [ ] Remove N+1: batch queries, use RPC where appropriate
- [ ] Tighten RLS; add tests for RLS policies
- [ ] Move secrets to env, never in repo; rotate if needed

## Phase 8 — Performance & Caching

- [ ] Route-level code splitting; avoid heavy client bundles
- [ ] Mark server-only modules with `server:` imports
- [ ] Cache GET endpoints with ETag/Cache-Control where safe
- [ ] Use `setHeaders` in loads for static-ish data
- [ ] Review `static/sw.js` for usefulness; either modernize or remove
- [ ] Defer non-critical JS, avoid layout thrash

## Phase 9 — Security & Hardening

- [ ] CSP via `vercel.json` or headers; block inline scripts except hashes
- [ ] Origin checks on POST; CSRF where applicable (actions validate origin)
- [ ] Rate limit sensitive routes
- [ ] Sanitize user content; encode HTML outputs
- [ ] Secure cookies: `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `SameSite`

## Phase 10 — Testing & Quality Gates

- [ ] Unit tests: critical utils, stores, loaders (Vitest)
- [ ] Component tests: key components with Svelte Testing Library
- [ ] E2E: Playwright happy paths + auth + payments
- [ ] Accessibility smoke via Axe in Playwright
- [ ] Visual snapshots locked; PRs must not change visuals
- [ ] Coverage thresholds in CI

## Phase 11 — CI/CD & Release

- [ ] CI: typecheck, lint, unit, e2e (smoke) on PR
- [ ] Cache pnpm store & Playwright browsers
- [ ] Vercel preview URL posted to PR
- [ ] Release checklist & canary deploy
- [ ] Rollback plan (previous Vercel deployment)

## Phase 12 — Docs & Handover

- [ ] Update `README.md`: scripts, development, testing, deployment
- [ ] Architecture notes: module boundaries, data flow, state stores
- [ ] ADRs for key decisions kept short
