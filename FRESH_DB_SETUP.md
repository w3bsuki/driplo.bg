# Fresh Database Setup Guide

## Step 1: Create NEW Supabase Project

1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Create NEW project (don't use existing!)
3. Save credentials

## Step 2: Run Migration

```bash
# Remove old link
rm -rf .supabase

# Initialize fresh
supabase init

# Link to NEW project
supabase link --project-ref [NEW-PROJECT-REF]

# Push optimized migration
supabase db push
```

## Step 3: Update .env

```env
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://[NEW-PROJECT].supabase.co
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[NEW-ANON-KEY]
```

## Step 4: Test

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

## What This Fixes:

✅ Removes 63 messy migrations → 1 clean schema
✅ Adds all missing indexes (12 foreign keys fixed)
✅ Optimized RLS policies (3-10x faster)
✅ Removes duplicate/unused tables
✅ Proper search indexes
✅ Clean, production-ready structure

## GPT: Audit & Setup Enhancements (do not remove existing info)

This section adds an audit of `supabase/migrations/20250109_fresh_optimized_schema.sql` and improvements to ensure a robust production-ready Supabase backend.

### Audit summary of 20250109_fresh_optimized_schema.sql

Strengths:

- Consolidates schema with sensible tables, FKs, and useful indexes (FKs, search, recency).
- RLS enabled on all user-data tables; messaging and notifications added to Realtime.
- Storage buckets pre-created with basic upload/read policies.
- Triggers set `updated_at`; functions use `SECURITY DEFINER` with `SET search_path = public` (good practice).

Gaps to address before calling this “perfect”:

- Profiles privacy: policy `profiles_public_read` exposes all columns (phone, payment_details). Recommend a read-only view `public_profiles` with safe columns and expose that publicly; restrict base table to row owner.
- INSERT safety in “FOR ALL” policies: policies like `favorites_own`, `user_notifications` and `user_follows` define only `USING`. Add matching `WITH CHECK` to constrain INSERT/UPDATE rows to the same predicate.
- Conversations creation: there is no INSERT policy for `conversations`. Users won’t be able to create conversations unless using a SECURITY DEFINER RPC. Add an insert policy for participants or provide an RPC.
- Messages insert guard: `messages_send` allows insert when `sender_id = auth.uid()`. Also ensure the sender is a participant in the referenced conversation.
- Orders update scope: `orders_participants_update` allows buyer/seller to UPDATE all columns. Restrict to allowed fields (e.g., status, tracking_number) via an RPC or a trigger; or split policies by role/column.
- Money types: consider storing currency amounts in integer minor units (cents) or ensure `NUMERIC(12,2)` with positive checks. Add `CHECK (total_amount >= 0)`.
- Username uniqueness: index on `lower(username)` exists but is not unique. Add a unique index to prevent case-variant duplicates.
- Order number default: random 4 digits can collide on busy days. Prefer a sequence-backed generator or a retry-on-conflict function.
- Additional checks: add `CHECK (buyer_id <> seller_id)` on `orders`; optional positive checks on prices, shipping_cost; consider NOT NULL where appropriate.
- Storage policies: uploads to `listings` bucket are allowed for any authenticated user with any path. Prefer requiring the first folder to match `auth.uid()` (or listing id) and add UPDATE/DELETE policies as needed.
- Grants: `GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated` is broad. RLS still protects access, but consider narrowing grants to the intended DML per table.

Conclusion: Solid base, not “perfect.” Apply the tweaks below for a hardened production setup.

### Recommended hardening (follow-up migration)

- Profiles privacy: create `public_profiles` view exposing: id, username, full_name, avatar_url, average_rating, total_reviews, is_seller, created_at. Update app to read from the view where public data is needed.
- Policies: add `WITH CHECK` to `favorites`, `user_follows`, and `user_notifications`; add `conversations` INSERT policy for participants; constrain `messages` INSERT so sender must be conversation participant.
- Constraints: unique index on `lower(username)`; checks for positive money; `buyer_id <> seller_id` on `orders`.
- Storage: require folder prefix to match user id for `listings` uploads; add delete/update policies.
- Order number: move to a function that generates unique, sequential numbers with retry.

These can be added as a new companion migration so the “fresh” file remains the baseline.

### Will these migrations set up a “perfect” Supabase backend?

- They will set up a working, mostly secure backend. Apply the hardening above to reach production-grade privacy and safety, especially around profiles, policies, storage, and order numbering.

### Windows-friendly setup commands

If you are on Windows PowerShell (default):

```powershell
# Remove old link
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .supabase -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Initialize fresh
supabase init

# Link to NEW project
supabase link --project-ref <NEW-PROJECT-REF>

# Push optimized migration(s) to the linked remote
supabase db push
```

Mac/Linux (bash):

```bash
rm -rf .supabase
supabase init
supabase link --project-ref <NEW-PROJECT-REF>
supabase db push
```

After linking, also reset your local dev DB from migrations if you use it:

```powershell
# Local reset (optional, affects the local Dockerized Postgres)
supabase db reset
```

### Post-push configuration checklist (Supabase Dashboard)

- Auth → Settings:
  - Set Site URL to your canonical `PUBLIC_APP_URL`.
  - Reduce OTP expiry to ≤ 15 minutes.
  - Enable leaked password protection (HIBP).
  - Configure SMTP or use Supabase emails; verify sender domain.
- Database → Replication: confirm `messages` and `user_notifications` are in Realtime publication.
- Storage → Buckets: verify buckets exist; set public/private as intended; review policies.
- API → RLS: verify policies match the hardening recommendations.

### App .env requirements

Set these in your environment (examples):

```env
PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://driplo.bg
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=...  # server-side only
```

### Validation steps

- Create two users, A and B. Verify:
  - A cannot read B’s sensitive profile fields from `profiles` (use the public view).
  - A can create a conversation with B (or via RPC) and send a message; non-participants cannot read it.
  - Favorites and follows can only be inserted/updated by the owning user.
  - Anonymous users can read active listings and public brands/categories only; can insert web vitals.
  - Storage uploads are constrained to the correct folder prefixes.

### Rollback plan

- If a migration fails on push, fix locally and re-run `supabase db push`.
- For destructive errors in a NEW project, delete the project and recreate to maintain a clean history.
