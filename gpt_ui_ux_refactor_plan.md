# UI/UX Improvement & Refactor Plan (Svelte 5 • SvelteKit 2 • TailwindCSS • shadcn-svelte)

Goal: Elevate the entire product’s UI/UX (mobile-first) for a modern, clean, conversion-focused clothing marketplace. Keep all features and layout semantics, improve quality, consistency, speed, and accessibility.

Non-goals: No new business features. No disruptive redesigns; incremental, measured upgrades.

Guiding principles
- Mobile-first; progressive enhancement
- Consistency via a lightweight design system (tokens + primitives)
- Accessibility AA+; keyboard-first interactions
- Perceived performance (skeletons, eager above-the-fold)
- Conversion clarity: primary CTA prominence, frictionless flows
- Svelte 5 idioms ($state/$derived), server-first where possible

Deliverables
- Design tokens in Tailwind theme (color, spacing, radius, shadows, typography)
- shadcn-svelte style UI primitives (Button, Input, Select, Dialog, Sheet, DropdownMenu, Tabs, Tooltip, Skeleton, Badge, Card, Pagination)
- Page-by-page refactor with checklists and acceptance criteria
- Accessibility and performance baselines across pages

---

Design System & Foundations
- Tailwind config
  - [ ] Define semantic color palette (bg, fg, muted, primary, destructive, ring)
  - [ ] Typography scale (12–18 base, 1.125 modular), line-heights, tracking
  - [ ] Spacing scale and container widths (xs→2xl) with safe areas
  - [ ] Radius tokens (sm/md/lg/full), shadows (sm/md/lg/outline)
  - [ ] Motion tokens for transitions (duration, easing), reduced motion
- UI primitives (shadcn-svelte equivalents)
  - [ ] Button (variants: default, outline, ghost, icon, destructive; sizes)
  - [ ] Input, Textarea, Select, Combobox, Checkbox, Radio, Toggle
  - [ ] Dialog/Modal, Sheet/Drawer (mobile filters/cart), Popover, Tooltip
  - [ ] Tabs, Accordion, Breadcrumbs, Pagination
  - [ ] Card, Badge, Alert, Skeleton, Separator, Progress
  - [ ] Toasts (svelte-sonner already used) unified styling
- Patterns
  - [ ] Form field with label, hint, error; Zod-driven messages
  - [ ] List/Grid wrappers (gaps, responsive columns)
